## Running Codes

Running Python codes is easy as running following command:
```bash
$ python <filename>
```
Also C++ codes that have been written in a single file can be used as follow:
```bash
$ g++ <filename> -o assignment
$ ./assignment
```
C++ codes with multiple files, contain a Makefile. So you should run the codes like this:
```bash
$ make
$ ./<executable-file>
```
